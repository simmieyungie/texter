#### checking package dependencies … NOTE

-   Depends: includes the non-default packages: ‘dplyr’, ‘plyr’,
    ‘ggplot2’, ‘magrittr’, ‘stringr’, ‘tidytext’, ‘purrr’, ‘stopwords’,
    ‘textdata’
-   Adding so many packages to the search path is excessive and
    importing selectively is preferable.

#### checking data for non-ASCII characters … WARNING

    Warning: found non-ASCII strings

    -- The contents have been converted from Ascii however, to preserve the contents as much as possible some of the non-ascii strings are left as is. This has been tested and won't have any effect on the results.
