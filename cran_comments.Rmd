#### checking package dependencies ... NOTE
* Depends: includes the non-default packages:
    'dplyr', 'plyr', 'ggplot2', 'magrittr', 'stringr', 'tidytext',
    'purrr', 'stopwords', 'textdata'
* Adding so many packages to the search path is excessive and importing
  selectively is preferable.

#### checking data for non-ASCII characters ... WARNING
    Warning: found non-ASCII strings
    
    -- The contents have been converted from Ascii however, to preserve the contents as much as possible some of the non-ascii strings are left as is. This has been tested and won't have any effect on the results.
